abstract="The dual-camera compressive hyperspectral imager (DCCHI) can capture 3D hyperspectral image (HSI) with a single snapshot. However, due to the high computation complexity of reconstruction methods, DCCHI cannot apply to the time-crucial applications. In this paper, we propose a GPU assisted towards real-time reconstruction framework for DCCHI. First, leveraging the fast convergence rate of the alternative direction multiplier method, we propose a reformative reconstruction algorithm which can achieve a fast convergence rate. Then, using the interpolation results of a low resolution reconstructed HSI as the warm start, we propose a fast reconstruction strategy to further reduce the computation burden. Last, a GPU parallel implementation is presented to achieve nearly real-time reconstruction. Evaluation experiments indicate our framework can obtain a significant promotion in reconstruction efficiency with a slight accuracy loss.",
