abstract="Interreflections exhibit a number of challenges for existing shape-from-intensity methods that only assume a direct lighting model. Removing the interreflections from scene observations is of broad interest since it enhances the accuracy of those methods. In this paper, we propose a method for removing interreflections from a single image using fluorescence. From a bispectral observation of reflective and fluorescent components recorded in distinct color channels, our method separates direct lighting from interreflections. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on complex and dynamic scenes. In addition, we show how our method improves an existing photometric stereo method in shape recovery.",
