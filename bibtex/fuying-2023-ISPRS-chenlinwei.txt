abstract = {A few well-annotated datasets for land-cover semantic segmentation have recently been introduced to advance the field of earth observation technologies. However, these datasets overlook the significant diversity among geographic areas with different climates, which can greatly impact and diversify land cover. Consequently, this leads to a domain gap in remote sensing images and severe performance degradation of the segmentation models. To enhance land-cover semantic segmentation with improved generalization ability, we conducted the first investigation into the impact of climate on this task. In this paper, we present a unique large-scale Climate-Aware Satellite Images Dataset (CASID) specifically designed for domain adaptive land-cover semantic segmentation. It consists of 980 satellite images with a size of 5000 Ã— 5000 pixels, collected from 30 different regions around Asia, covering over 24,500 square kilometers. These images are gathered from four distinct climate zones, namely temperate monsoon, subtropical monsoon, tropical monsoon, and tropical rainforest. It includes four sub-datasets/domains, each representing one of the aforementioned climate zones. This characteristic makes CASID the first climate-aware land-cover semantic segmentation dataset with multiple domains. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the samples from the four climate zones, emphasizing differences in global image features, image texture, category distribution, spectral value, and object shape. These analyses offer valuable insights for subsequent research in this field. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the latest semantic segmentation and unsupervised domain adaptation methods on the CASID dataset. These results serve as a robust baseline for future research endeavors. Our dataset will be made publicly available soon at the following link: https://github.com/Linwei-Chen/CASID.}
